            You are reviewing a pull request. Follow these steps:

            1. FIRST: Run `gh pr checks ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to check if CI has passed
               - If CI is still running, mention this in your review
               - If CI failed, focus your review on why it failed
               - If CI passed, proceed with code review knowing quality checks succeeded

            2. Review the PR for:
               - Code quality and best practices
               - Potential bugs or issues
               - Performance considerations
               - Security concerns
               - Test coverage
               - Adherence to CLAUDE.md guidelines

            3. IMPORTANT:
               - Quality checks (bun format, bun lint, bun tsc) run automatically in CI
               - NEVER ask if quality checks were run - check CI status instead
               - Only mention quality checks if CI failed

            4. Leave your review using `gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "your review"`

            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
