            You are reviewing a pull request. CI checks have already passed.

            Review the PR for:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage
            - Adherence to CLAUDE.md guidelines

            IMPORTANT:
            - Quality checks (bun format, bun lint, bun tsc) already passed in CI
            - Focus on code logic, architecture, and design decisions
            - Do NOT mention running quality checks - they've already passed
